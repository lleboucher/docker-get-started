Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy your containerized 
applications on top of it. To do so, you create a Kubernetes 'Deployment' 
configuration. The Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create and update 
instances of your application. Once you've created a Deployment, the 
Kubernetes master schedules mentioned application instances onto individual 
Nodes in the cluster.

Once the application instances are created, a Kubernetes Deployment Controller 
continuously monitors those instances. If the Node hosting an instance goes 
down or is deleted, the Deployment controller replaces the instance with an 
instance on another Node in the cluster. This provides a self-healing 
mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance.

In a pre-orchestration world, installation scripts would often be used to 
start applications, but they did not allow recovery from machine failure. By 
both creating your application instances and keeping them running across 
Nodes, Kubernetes Deployments provide a fundamentally different approach to 
application management.


3.1 - Kubernetes Deployments
============================

To deploy your containerized application on top of the cluster, you create what 
is called a "Kubernetes Deployment". The Deployment maerializes through a text 
file which defines the target state of your application (which application - 
i.e. which Docker container or which set of containers which compose your 
application -, on how many nodes - in order to bring resilience - or other 
criterias your application should respect once it is actually deployed on the 
cluster). This text file instructs Kubernetes how to create and update 
instances of your application (actually, it tells the Kubernetes Controller 
Manager to spawn a Deployment Controller which will read this text file: the 
Deployment Controller will tell the Kubernetes master how to 'schedules' 
mentioned pods onto individual Nodes in the cluster, each pod carrying the 
containers composing your application).

Once the application instances are created, the Kubernetes Deployment 
Controller continuously monitors those instances. If the Node hosting an 
instance goes down or is deleted, the Deployment controller replaces the 
instance with an instance on another Node in the cluster. This provides a 
self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance: since the 
text file describes the desired target state of the deployment, the Deployment 
controller actually detects that there is a deviation of the real deployment 
vs. the described target, and it reacts by deploying more pods to available 
nodes.

In a pre-orchestration world, installation scripts would often be used to start 
applications, but they did not allow recovery from machine failure. By both 
creating your application instances and keeping them running across Nodes, 
Kubernetes Deployments provide a fundamentally different approach to 
application management.


3.2 - Deploying your first app on Kubernetes
============================================

You can create and manage a Deployment by using the Kubernetes command line 
interface, Kubectl. Kubectl uses the Kubernetes API to interact with the 
cluster. In this module, you'll learn the most common Kubectl commands needed 
to create Deployments that run your applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

When you create a Deployment, you'll need to specify the container image for 
your application and the number of replicas that you want to run. You can 
change that information later by updating your Deployment; sections 3.5 and 3.6 
of this tutorial discuss how you can scale and update your Deployments.

Applications need to be packaged into one of the supported container formats in 
order to be deployed on Kubernetes: here we will use Docker.

For your first Deployment, you'll use a Node.js application packaged in a 
Docker container. The image is provided in the Kubernetes official site
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/), so we don't have to 
actually code a new application for our tutorial. The corresponding node.js 
script and the dockerfile are available in the "hello-world" directory if you
want to build your local image.

Let’s deploy our first app on Kubernetes with the 'kubectl create deployment'
command. We need to provide the deployment name and app image location 
(include the full repository url for images hosted outside Docker hub).

tso@laptop:~$ kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1

Great! You just deployed your first application by creating a deployment. This 
performed a few things for you:

    - searched for a suitable node where an instance of the application could 
      be run (we have only 1 available node)
    - scheduled the application to run on that Node
    - configured the cluster to reschedule the instance on a new Node when 
      needed

To list your deployments use the get deployments command:

$ kubectl get deployments

We see that there is 1 deployment running a single instance of your app. The 
instance is running inside a Docker container on your node.




3.3 - Deploying an App
======================

Pods that are running inside Kubernetes are running on a private, isolated 
network. By default they are visible from other pods and services within the 
same kubernetes cluster, but not outside that network. When we use kubectl, 
we're interacting through an API endpoint to communicate with our application.

We will cover other options on how to expose your application outside the 
kubernetes cluster in the later section.

The kubectl command can create a proxy that will forward communications into 
the cluster-wide, private network. The proxy can be terminated by pressing 
control-C and won't show any output while its running.

We will open a second terminal window to run the proxy.

$ echo -e "\n\n\n\e[92mStarting Proxy. After starting it will not output a response. Please click the first Terminal Tab\n"; 
kubectl proxy

We now have a connection between our host (the online terminal) and the 
Kubernetes cluster. The proxy enables direct access to the API from these 
terminals.

You can see all those APIs hosted through the proxy endpoint. For example, we 
can query the version directly through the API using the curl command:

$ curl http://localhost:8001/version
{
  "major": "1",
  "minor": "17",
  "gitVersion": "v1.17.0",
  "gitCommit": "70132b0f130acc0bed193d9ba59dd186f0e634cf",
  "gitTreeState": "clean",
  "buildDate": "2019-12-07T21:12:17Z",
  "goVersion": "go1.13.4",
  "compiler": "gc",
  "platform": "linux/amd64"
}

If Port 8001 is not accessible, ensure that the kubectl proxy started above is 
running.

The API server will automatically create an endpoint for each pod, based on 
the pod name, that is also accessible through the proxy.

First we need to get the Pod name, and we'll store in the environment variable 
POD_NAME:

$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME

Note: Check the top of the terminal. The proxy was run in a new tab 
(Terminal 2), and the recent commands were executed the original tab 
(Terminal 1). The proxy still runs in the second tab, and this allowed our 
curl command to work using localhost:8001.

In order for the new deployment to be accessible without using the Proxy, a 
Service is required which will be explained in the next modules.



3.4 - Explore your app
======================


3.4.1 - Kubernetes Pods
=======================

When you created a Deployment in Module 2, Kubernetes created a Pod to host 
your application instance. A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a 
group of one or more application containers (such as Docker or rkt), and some 
shared resources for those containers. Those resources include:

    - Shared storage, as Volumes
    - Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
    - Information about how to run each container, such as the container image 
        version or specific ports to use

A Pod models an application-specific "logical host" and can contain different 
application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. For example, a 
Pod might include both the container with your Node.js app as well as a 
different container that feeds the data to be published by the Node.js 
webserver. The containers in a Pod share an IP Address and port space, are 
always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context on the same 
Node.

Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform. When we create a 
Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers inside 
them (as opposed to creating containers directly). Each Pod is tied to the 
Node where it is scheduled, and remains there until termination (according to 
restart policy) or deletion. In case of a Node failure, identical Pods are 
scheduled on other available Nodes in the cluster.

Pods overview (image "view your app - pod overview")

 
3.4.2 - Nodes
===========

A Pod always runs on a Node. A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may 
be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each Node 
is managed by the Master. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes 
master automatically handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the 
cluster. The Master's automatic scheduling takes into account the available 
resources on each Node.

Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:

    - Kubelet, a process responsible for communication between the Kubernetes 
        Master and the Node; it manages the Pods and the containers running on 
        a machine.
    - A container runtime (like Docker, rkt) responsible for pulling the 
        container image from a registry, unpacking the container, and running 
        the application.

Containers should only be scheduled together in a single Pod if they are tightly coupled and need to share resources such as disk.

Node overview (image "view your app - node overview")


3.4.3 - Troubleshooting with kubectl
==================================

In Module 2, you used Kubectl command-line interface. You'll continue to use 
it in Module 3 to get information about deployed applications and their 
environments. The most common operations can be done with the following 
kubectl commands:

    kubectl get - list resources
    kubectl describe - show detailed information about a resource
    kubectl logs - print the logs from a container in a pod
    kubectl exec - execute a command on a container in a pod

You can use these commands to see when applications were deployed, what their 
current statuses are, where they are running and what their configurations 
are.

Now that we know more about our cluster components and the command line, let's 
explore our application.

3.4.4 - Check application configuration
======================================

Let’s verify that the application we deployed in the previous scenario is 
running. We’ll use the kubectl get command and look for existing Pods:

$ kubectl get pods

If no pods are running then it means the interactive environment is still 
reloading it's previous state. Please wait a couple of seconds and list the 
Pods again. You can continue once you see the one Pod running.

Next, to view what containers are inside that Pod and what images are used to 
build those containers we run the describe pods command:

$ kubectl describe pods

We see here details about the Pod’s container: IP address, the ports used and 
a list of events related to the lifecycle of the Pod.

The output of the describe command is extensive and covers some concepts that 
we didn’t explain yet, but don’t worry, they will become familiar by the end 
of this bootcamp.

    Note: the describe command can be used to get detailed information about 
        most of the kubernetes primitives: node, pods, deployments. The 
        describe output is designed to be human readable, not to be scripted 
        against.


3.4.5 - Show the app in the terminal
===================================

Recall that Pods are running in an isolated, private network - so we need to 
proxy access to them so we can debug and interact with them. To do this, we'll 
use the kubectl proxy command to run a proxy in a second terminal window. 
Click on the command below to automatically open a new terminal and run the 
proxy:

$ echo -e "\n\n\n\e[92mStarting Proxy. After starting it will not output a response. Please click the first Terminal Tab\n"; kubectl proxy

Now again, we'll get the Pod name and query that pod directly through the 
proxy. To get the Pod name and store it in the POD_NAME environment variable:

$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME

To see the output of our application, run a curl request.

$ curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/$POD_NAME/proxy/

The url is the route to the API of the Pod.


3.4.6 - View the container logs
==============================

Anything that the application would normally send to STDOUT becomes logs for 
the container within the Pod. We can retrieve these logs using the kubectl 
logs command:

$ kubectl logs $POD_NAME

Note: We don’t need to specify the container name, because we only have one 
container inside the pod.


3.4.7 - Executing command on the container
=========================================

We can execute commands directly on the container once the Pod is up and 
running. For this, we use the exec command and use the name of the Pod as a 
parameter. Let’s list the environment variables:

$ kubectl exec $POD_NAME env

Again, worth mentioning that the name of the container itself can be omitted 
since we only have a single container in the Pod.

Next let’s start a bash session in the Pod’s container:

$ kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME bash

We have now an open console on the container where we run our NodeJS 
application, and we are logged as root. The source code of the app is in the 
server.js file:

# cat server.js

You can check that the application is up by running a curl command:

# curl localhost:8080

    Note: here we used localhost because we executed the command inside the 
        NodeJS Pod. If you cannot connect to localhost:8080, check to make 
        sure you have run the kubectl exec command and are launching the 
        command from within the Pod

To close your container connection type "exit".



3.5 - Expose Your App Publicly
==============================


3.5.1 - Overview of Kubernetes Services
=====================================

Kubernetes Pods are mortal. Pods in fact have a lifecycle. When a worker node 
dies, the Pods running on the Node are also lost. A ReplicaSet might then 
dynamically drive the cluster back to desired state via creation of new Pods 
to keep your application running. As another example, consider an 
image-processing backend with 3 replicas. Those replicas are exchangeable; the 
front-end system should not care about backend replicas or even if a Pod is 
lost and recreated. That said, each Pod in a Kubernetes cluster has a unique 
IP address, even Pods on the same Node, so there needs to be a way of 
automatically reconciling changes among Pods so that your applications 
continue to function.

A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods 
and a policy by which to access them. Services enable a loose coupling between 
dependent Pods. A Service is defined using YAML (preferred) or JSON, like all 
Kubernetes objects. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually 
determined by a LabelSelector (see below for why you might want a Service 
without including selector in the spec): a LabelSelector is a the way 
Kubernetes will identify the right pods

Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those IPs are not exposed outside 
the cluster without a Service. Services allow your applications to receive 
traffic (from outside or from other applications runnig on the same cluster). 
Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a type in the 
ServiceSpec:

    - ClusterIP (default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the 
        cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the 
        cluster.
    - NodePort - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in 
        the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the 
        cluster using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>. Superset of ClusterIP.
    - LoadBalancer - Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud 
        (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. 
        Superset of NodePort.
    - ExternalName - Exposes the Service using an arbitrary name (specified by 
        externalName in the spec) by returning a CNAME record with the name. 
        No proxy is used. This type requires v1.7 or higher of kube-dns.


Additionally, note that there are some use cases with Services that involve 
not defining selector in the spec. A Service created without selector will 
also not create the corresponding Endpoints object. This allows users to 
manually map a Service to specific endpoints. Another possibility why there 
may be no selector is you are strictly using type: ExternalName.


3.5.2 - Services and Labels
=========================

(image: "expose your app - 1")

A Service routes traffic across a set of Pods. Services are the abstraction 
that allow pods to die and replicate in Kubernetes without impacting your 
application. Discovery and routing among dependent Pods (such as the frontend 
and backend components in an application) is handled by Kubernetes Services.

Services match a set of Pods using labels and selectors, a grouping primitive 
that allows logical operation on objects in Kubernetes. Labels are key/value 
pairs attached to objects and can be used in any number of ways:

    - Designate objects for development, test, and production
    - Embed version tags
    - Classify an object using tags


(image: "expose your app - 2")

Labels can be attached to objects at creation time or later on. They can be 
modified at any time. Let's expose our application now using a Service and 
apply some labels.


3.5.3 - Create a new service
============================

Let’s verify that our application is running. We’ll use the kubectl get 
command and look for existing Pods:

$ kubectl get pods

If no pods are running then it means the interactive environment is still 
reloading its previous state. Please wait a couple of seconds and list the 
Pods again. You can continue once you see the one Pod running.

Next, let’s list the current Services from our cluster:

$ kubectl get services
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP  EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)     AGE
kubernetes  ClusterUP   10.96.0.1   <none>          443/TCP     89s

We have a Service called kubernetes that is created by default when minikube 
starts the cluster. To create a new service and expose it to external traffic 
we’ll use the expose command with NodePort as parameter (minikube does not 
support the LoadBalancer option yet).

$ kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080
service/kubernetes-bootcamp exposed

Let’s run again the get services command:

$ kubectl get services

We have now a running Service called kubernetes-bootcamp. Here we see that 
the Service received a unique cluster-IP, an internal port and an external-IP 
(the IP of the Node).

To find out what port was opened externally (by the NodePort option) we’ll run 
the describe service command:

$ kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp

Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has the value of the Node 
port assigned:

$ export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT

Now we can test that the app is exposed outside of the cluster using curl, the 
IP of the Node and the externally exposed port:

$ curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT

And we get a response from the server. The Service is exposed.


3.5.4 - Using labels
====================

The Deployment created automatically a label for our Pod. With describe 
deployment command you can see the name of the label:

$ kubectl describe deployment

Let’s use this label to query our list of Pods. We’ll use the kubectl get pods 
command with -l as a parameter, followed by the label values:

$ kubectl get pods -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp

You can do the same to list the existing services:

$ kubectl get services -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp

Get the name of the Pod and store it in the POD_NAME environment variable:

$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}')
echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME

To apply a new label we use the label command followed by the object type, 
object name and the new label:

$ kubectl label pod $POD_NAME app=v1

This will apply a new label to our Pod (we pinned the application version to 
the Pod), and we can check it with the describe pod command:

$ kubectl describe pods $POD_NAME

We see here that the label is attached now to our Pod. And we can query now 
the list of pods using the new label:

$ kubectl get pods -l app=v1

And we see the Pod.


3.5.5 - Deleting a service
=========================

To delete Services you can use the delete service command. Labels can be used 
also here:

$ kubectl delete service -l run=kubernetes-bootcamp

Confirm that the service is gone:

$ kubectl get services

This confirms that our Service was removed. To confirm that route is not 
exposed anymore you can curl the previously exposed IP and port:

$ curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT

This proves that the app is not reachable anymore from outside of the cluster. 
You can confirm that the app is still running with a curl inside the pod:

$ kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME curl localhost:8080

We see here that the application is up. This is because the Deployment is 
managing the application. To shut down the application, you would need to 
delete the Deployment as well.



3.6 - Scale Your App
====================


3.6.1 - Explanation - Scaling an application
============================

In the previous modules we created a Deployment, and then exposed it publicly 
via a Service. The Deployment created only one Pod for running our application. 
When traffic increases, we will need to scale the application to keep up with 
user demand.

Scaling is accomplished by changing the number of replicas in a Deployment.

(image - "scale your app - 1")
(image - "scale your app - 2")

Scaling out a Deployment will ensure new Pods are created and scheduled to 
Nodes with available resources. Scaling will increase the number of Pods to the 
new desired state. Kubernetes also supports autoscaling of Pods, but it is 
outside of the scope of this tutorial. Scaling to zero is also possible, and it 
will terminate all Pods of the specified Deployment.

Running multiple instances of an application will require a way to distribute 
the traffic to all of them. Services have an integrated load-balancer that will 
distribute network traffic to all Pods of an exposed Deployment. Services will 
monitor continuously the running Pods using endpoints, to ensure the traffic is 
sent only to available Pods.


Once you have multiple instances of an Application running, you would be able 
to do Rolling updates without downtime. We'll cover that in the next module. 
Now, let's go to the online terminal and scale our application.


3.6.2 - Scaling a deployment
============================

To list your deployments use the get deployments command:

$ kubectl get deployments

We should have 1 Pod. If not, run the command again. This shows:

    - READY shows the ratio of CURRENT to DESIRED replicas
        * CURRENT is the number of replicas running now
        * DESIRED is the configured number of replicas
    - UP-TO-DATE is the number of replicas that were updated to match the 
        desired (configured) state
    - AVAILABLE state shows how many replicas are actually AVAILABLE to the 
        users

Next, let’s scale the Deployment to 4 replicas. We’ll use the kubectl scale 
command, followed by the deployment type, name and desired number of 
instances:

$ kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=4

To list your Deployments once again, use get deployments:

$ kubectl get deployments

The change was applied, and we have 4 instances of the application available. 
Next, let’s check if the number of Pods changed:

$ kubectl get pods -o wide

There are 4 Pods now, with different IP addresses. The change was registered 
in the Deployment events log. To check that, use the describe command:

$ kubectl describe deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp

You can also view in the output of this command that there are 4 replicas now.


3.6.3 - Load Balancing
======================

Let’s check that the Service is load-balancing the traffic. To find out the 
exposed IP and Port we can use the describe service as we learned in the 
previously Module:

$ kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp

Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has a value as the Node 
port:

$ export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT

Next, we’ll do a curl to the exposed IP and port. Execute the command multiple 
times:

$ curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT

We hit a different Pod with every request. This demonstrates that the 
load-balancing is working.


3.6.4 - Scale Down
==================

To scale down the Service to 2 replicas, run again the scale command:

$ kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=2

List the Deployments to check if the change was applied with the get 
deployments command:

$ kubectl get deployments

The number of replicas decreased to 2. List the number of Pods, with get pods:

$ kubectl get pods -o wide

This confirms that 2 Pods were terminated.



3.7 - Update Your App
=====================


3.7.1 - Updating an application
=============================

Users expect applications to be available all the time and developers are 
expected to deploy new versions of them several times a day. In Kubernetes 
this is done with rolling updates. Rolling updates allow Deployments' update 
to take place with zero downtime by incrementally updating Pods instances with 
new ones. The new Pods will be scheduled on Nodes with available resources.

In the previous module we scaled our application to run multiple instances. 
This is a requirement for performing updates without affecting application 
availability. By default, the maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable 
during the update and the maximum number of new Pods that can be created, is 
one. Both options can be configured to either numbers or percentages (of 
Pods). In Kubernetes, updates are versioned and any Deployment update can be 
reverted to previous (stable) version.


3.7.2 - Rolling updates overview
==============================

(image: "update your app - 1")
(image: "update your app - 2")
(image: "update your app - 3")
(image: "update your app - 4")

Similar to application Scaling, if a Deployment is exposed publicly, the 
Service will load-balance the traffic only to available Pods during the 
update. An available Pod is an instance that is available to the users of the 
application.

Rolling updates allow the following actions:

    - Promote an application from one environment to another (via container 
        image updates)
    - Rollback to previous versions
    - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of applications with zero 
        downtime


3.7.3 - Update the version of the app
=====================================

To list your deployments use the get deployments command: 

$ kubectl get deployments

To list the running Pods use the get pods command:

$ kubectl get pods

To view the current image version of the app, run a describe command against 
the Pods (look at the Image field):

$ kubectl describe pods

To update the image of the application to version 2, use the set image 
command, followed by the deployment name and the new image version:

$ kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v2

The command notified the Deployment to use a different image for your app and 
initiated a rolling update. Check the status of the new Pods, and view the old 
one terminating with the get pods command:

$ kubectl get pods


3.7.4 - Verify an update
========================

First, let’s check that the App is running. To find out the exposed IP and 
Port we can use describe service:

$ kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp

Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has the value of the Node 
port assigned:

$ export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT

Next, we’ll do a curl to the the exposed IP and port:

$ curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT

We hit a different Pod with every request and we see that all Pods are running 
the latest version (v2).

The update can be confirmed also by running a rollout status command:

$ kubectl rollout status deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp

To view the current image version of the app, run a describe command against 
the Pods:

$ kubectl describe pods

We run now version 2 of the app (look at the Image field)


3.7.5 - Rollback an update
==========================

Let’s perform another update, and deploy image tagged as v10 :

$ kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v10

Use get deployments to see the status of the deployment:

$ kubectl get deployments

And something is wrong… We do not have the desired number of Pods available. 
List the Pods again:

$ kubectl get pods

A describe command on the Pods should give more insights:

$ kubectl describe pods

There is no image called v10 in the repository. Let’s roll back to our 
previously working version. We’ll use the rollout undo command:

$ kubectl rollout undo deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp

The rollout command reverted the deployment to the previous known state 
(v2 of the image). Updates are versioned and you can revert to any previously 
know state of a Deployment. List again the Pods:

$ kubectl get pods

Four Pods are running. Check again the image deployed on the them:

$ kubectl describe pods

We see that the deployment is using a stable version of the app (v2). The 
Rollback was successful.
